# TheatreVertigoRentalArea

As a Software Developer Intern at Prosper I.T. Consulting, I had the opportunity to work on a portion of a website for a theatre, Theatre Vertigo. This site is an ASP.NET MVC 5 application that uses Entity Framework 6 for data access, and Bootstrap for styling. I worked on the Rental Histories arrea of the website. Utilizing Code-Based Migrations, I created a model for the Rental Histories and then scaffolded a controller with views to enable basic CRUD functionality.

I customized the listing of rentals so that rentals that were damaged would display with a red X, and rentals that weren't damaged would display with a gren check mark.

I implemented sorting functionality, so that the list can be sorted by damaged or undamaged rentals

I also implemented accordion functionality. If the description of the damage is long, it is shortened by default; if you click on it, you will see the full listing.
