# TheatreVertigoRentalArea

## Introduction

As a Software Developer Intern at Prosper I.T. Consulting, I had the opportunity to work on a portion of a website for a theatre, Theatre Vertigo. This site is an ASP.NET MVC 5 application that uses Entity Framework 6 for data access. I worked on the Rental Histories arrea of the website. Utilizing Code-Based Migrations, I created a model for the Rental Histories and then scaffolded a controller with views.

I customized the listing of rental histories so that rentals that were damaged would display with a red X, and rentals that weren't damaged would display with a gren check mark.
